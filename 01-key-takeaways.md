# Lesson 01 Key Takeaways

**Steps to build a test automation framework** 

## Set up project

1. Choose the right tools and frameworks

- Ensure the tools are available on the server systems
- Prefer solutions with a short learning curve for team members
- Choose frameworks that are actively maintained and regularly updated
- Prioritize strong documentation and an active community for support
- Confirm that at least one engineer familiar with the language or stack is available

2. Initialize the project

- Set up the base project structure, including core pages and utility functions to accelerate development
- Define coding conventions and document the workflow for the team to follow consistently.

3. Configure the test runner and refine the framework

- Run the base project at a small scale to ensure everything works as expected.
- Refine and adjust the structure until the team is fully comfortable with it.
- Continuously improve and extend the framework as new requirements arise.
